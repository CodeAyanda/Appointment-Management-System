# Appointment-Management-Project

Appointment Management System for Just Environmental Services.
Just Environmental Services is a local pesticide and fumigation company that still uses a traditional way of appointent keeping.
This project was run for the whole year through two university modules namely ISTN3AS(first semester) and ISTN3SI (second semester).
This was a group project with five other colleagues.

*Website*

The website is made with ASP on the .NET framework and uses a SQL database. 
The website has the pages:
-Home Page
-About
-Services(lists all the services the business provides)
-Reviews
-Clients and Appointments(private pages)
-Pest Controllers(private page)
-Reports(uses Crystal Reports)(private page)

Contributions:
Front-End and backend for the private pages:

Clients and Appointments - Clients can login to create an account, 
Update their existing information, Create a new appointment(System accomodates for double booking),
View current and past appointments, Cancel ongoing appointments.
The appointments page was the most important page in the system since most of the work is done through the appointments page.

Pest Controllers - Pest controllers can view their schedules and also search and view client information for appointment purposes.

Reports - The website utilises Crystal Reports to show reports like funds generated from each customer and pest controller. I would have also liked to use parameterized reports but because of time it could not be implemented)


*Desktop App*

The desktop version has similar pages to the website with extra features to print out a receipt for the customer. This is only available for when the manager is logged in.
The app was created first in the first semester and the website followed in the second semester.
